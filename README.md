# Venieors4900
The purpose of this repo is mainly for design purposes rather than an actual integration of it into the official Veniero’s Website. It is in the works as a separate domain to be scanned for a QR code rather than a direct link to the official website. 


The main priorities for this project will be how the online cafe menu will look like and will prioritize mobile viewing optimization and compatibility 


# First Steps 
There won’t be much here for now as the current meetings are still finalizing the main menu (price changes/ changing items/ creating new drinks) all to which I am also in charge of. Am also currently starting the wireframe for the online menu before implementing.
